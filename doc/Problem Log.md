# Problem Log

## Pytorch3D install issue (26.05)

```
When setup the environment for the paper "Scaling Diffusion Models to Real-World 3D LiDAR Scene Completion" ([code](https://github.com/PRBonn/LiDiff)), I had issues with installing the PyTorch3D package on Windows. The installation process is quite cumbersome. I have now matched the versions of CUDA (12.1), Torch (2.2.0), and NVIDIA CUB (2.0.1), and downloaded the corresponding version of PyTorch3D (0.7.6) as a compressed package. However, it seems that on Windows, PyTorch3D needs to be compiled and installed using the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019 with administrative privileges?
